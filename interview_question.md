1. What happens when a user enters a URL into the browser?
    * The browser client first has to know what server to send the request to. It does a DNS lookup on the domain name to get the ip address of the server. Most URLs the user types in is them requesting a specific page. So a GET request is sent to that server. The http request has a header, a blank line, and an optional body. The first header line is the request line and consists of the HTTP method/verb, then the URI, then the protocol. So something like `GET /about HTTP/1.1`. The only required header field is `Server:` so that it's known where the request is being sent to. There are other headers like `Content-type:`, `Content-length:`, and custom ones that start with `X-`. After the request is sent to the server. 3 way handshake is done to establish connection between client and server. After, the server sends a response which looks similar to the request. The response consists of the header, a blank line, and the body. The first line of the head is the response line and consists of the protocol, the status code, and the status message. E.g: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`. The body or payload has the information/document requested by the client.
